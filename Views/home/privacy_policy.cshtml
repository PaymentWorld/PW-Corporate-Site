               PaymentWorld takes privacy and data protection issues seriously.  We have designed this Privacy Policy to explain how we handle personally 
               identifiable information collected from merchants who register for services and submit information to PaymentWorld through the Internet.<br /><br />
               As the PaymentWorld services evolve, we may revise this policy, so please check back frequently.  If you have questions about PaymentWorld 
               privacy practices please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@paymentworld.com">info@paymentworld.com</a>.<br /><br />
               You will receive an auto response from us confirming that we have received your e-mail.  If you do not receive an auto-response, please contact 
               PaymentWorld Customer Support by phone or chat.<br /><br />
               <span class="middleboxTitle">Scope Privacy Policy Basics</span><br /><br />
               This Privacy Policy covers PaymentWorld’s treatment of personally identifiable information collected from merchants (hereafter “merchant” or “you”) 
               who use the PaymentWorld payment gateway services, as well as consumer information that we acquire in the course of our business.  This Policy also 
               covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that PaymentWorld’s business partners may share with it.<br /><br />
               This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that PaymentWorld does not own or control, or to people that PaymentWorld does not 
               employ or manage.<br /><br />
                <span class="middleboxTitle">Information Collected and It's Use</span><br /><br />
                PaymentWorld collects personally identifiable information when you register for an PaymentWorld account, and when you use certain 
                PaymentWorld products and services.  PaymentWorld may also receive personally identifiable information from its resellers and other 
                business partners.<br /><br />                
                When you register with PaymentWorld, we ask for your contact information (such as your name, street address and email address), as well as 
                certain information pertaining to your business, along with billing information such as a bank account and/or credit card number.<br /><br />
                In the course of processing a payment transaction, we typically receive from the merchant or a financial institution information related to the transaction.  This 
                normally includes information about the payment that a consumer has furnished the merchant or financial institution in placing the order.  We do not acquire 
                any information directly from consumers through the <a href="http://paymentworld.com">www.paymentworld.com </a> Web site.<br /><br />
                The personally identifiable information we acquire in processing payment transactions varies according to the nature of the transaction and the way in which 
                merchants or financial institutions are using our payment services.  It may include, for example, the amount of the transaction, the consumer’s name, 
                credit card number and expiration date, checking account number, billing address, and shipping address.<br /><br />
                PaymentWorld uses the information collected to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to process payment transactions, to facilitate 
                billing, and otherwise deliver the payment gateway services.  We may also send merchants service announcements, newsletters, and periodic notices about specials, 
                new products and services and products and services offered by PaymentWorld business partners.  Personally identifiable consumer information is used to 
                process payment transactions and for no other purpose.<br /><br />
                PaymentWorld does not offer services or sell products to children.  PaymentWorld does not request or knowingly collect personally identifiable 
                contact information from anyone under the age of 13.<br /><br />
                <span class="middleboxTitle">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span><br /><br />
                Protecting personally identifiable information about merchants and consumers is an important part of our business.  We share and disclose such information only as 
                described below.<br /><br />
                PaymentWorld sends personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people: 1) when we have your consent to share the information; 2) when we need to share your information with third parties, such as banks and credit card processors, to provide the product or service you have requested; 3) in connection with products and services offered by PaymentWorld business partners and/or companies who work on behalf of PaymentWorld to provide a product or service to you; 4) to comply with federal, state and local laws, including credit reporting laws and card association rules; 5) it is necessary to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of our Merchant Agreement and other applicable agreements; or 6) it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of PaymentWorld, our users, or others, which may include the exchange of information with other organizations for fraud protection and/or risk reduction.<br />
                In the event that PaymentWorld is acquired, merchant account information may be one of the transferred assets. <br /><br />
                <span class="middleboxTitle">Information Security</span><br /><br />
                Information security is critical to our business.  We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, 
                which encrypts information you input.  We store information gathered on secure computers located in a locked data center.  The number of employees involved in the 
                management of the data center that have physical access to these computers is limited.  We use firewalls and other security technology to prevent our computers from 
                being accessed by unauthorized persons.<br /><br />
                We also require that any personally identifiable consumer information sent to us by you be encrypted using SSL encryption. <br /><br />
                It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your Login ID/password and to your computer.  Be sure to sign off when finished using a computer, whether or not it is shared, and otherwise protect and periodically change the password used to access the PaymentWorld services.<br /><br />
                <span class="middleboxTitle">Account Information and Preferences</span><br /><br />
                PaymentWorld gives you the ability to edit your PaymentWorld Account Information and preferences at any time, including whether you want 
                PaymentWorld to contact you about specials and new products, by using the Settings option in your Merchant Menu (see the PaymentWorld Merchant 
                Menu User Guide for more details), or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@paymentworld.com">info@paymentworld.com</a>.<br /><br />
                <span class="middleboxTitle">Changes to this This Privacy Policy</span><br /><br />
                PaymentWorld reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.  If there are material changes to this 
                statement or in how PaymentWorld will use personally identifiable information, PaymentWorld will post notice on the PaymentWorld 
                homepage at <a href="http://paymentworld.com">www.paymentworld.com </a> prior to implementing the change.  The amended Terms shall automatically become effective immediately after they are posted.  Your
                 continued use of the site or PaymentWorld services after the posting of the amended Terms on the Site constitutes your affirmative: (a) acknowledgement of 
                 the terms and its modifications; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the terms, as amended.  If you have additional questions about this Policy, please contact 
                 us at <a href="mailto:info@paymentworld.com">info@paymentworld.com</a>.
